/**
 * This package has classes that represent different modules in the library system.
 * It has the basic structures for books, users, and borrow records of the library.
 * <p>
 * Each class in this package is like a blueprint that helps the program understand and organize information.
 * For example, the Book class defines how book details are stored, while the User class defines user information.
 * <p>
 * These classes act as containers for information and help the program manage and keep track of library data.
 * They're used by other parts of the program, like services, to handle tasks and actions in the library system.
